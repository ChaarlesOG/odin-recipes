Before: In this project I'll try to apply everything I've learn about html until now, wish me luck!

After: In my opinion I was sucesful at building some code in html.
I remembered almost everything that I've learned in Odin Project except the things related to GitHub.
I looked into it and besides not being 100% at it still retained some more informantion that the last time!
